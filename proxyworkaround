**Workaround for a known issue with TelemetryProxyServer on disconnected machines running Sense version 10.8048.22439.1065**

Problem description:
When using the TelemetryProxyServer setting to specify a proxy to be used by the EDR component of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, on machines that have no other way to access the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) URL, a missing intermediate certificate will cause the EDR sensor to not successfully connect to the cloud service.

Affected versions:
-Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Sense version number 10.8048.22439.1065 or earlier preview versions
-Running on Windows Server 2012 R2

Workaround:
1. Ensure the machine is running Sense version 10.8048.22439.1065 or higher by either installing using the latest package available from the onboarding page, or by applying KB5005292.
2. Download and unzip the certificate from https://github.com/microsoft/mdefordownlevelserver/blob/main/InterCA.zip
3. Import the certificate to the Local Computer trusted “Intermediate Certification Authorities” store.
You can use the command:
Import-Certificate -FilePath .\InterCA.cer -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Ca
3. Check the “SENSE” event log and ensure that the machine has authenticated with cloud and is able to receive proper configuration through the CnC channel.
